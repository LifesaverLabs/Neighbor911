# Pre-Mortem

## What's a Pre-Mortem?

A premortem is a strategic planning exercise used to identify potential reasons a project or initiative might fail—before it begins. Unlike a postmortem, which analyzes failure after the fact, a premortem assumes the project has failed and asks participants to explain why. This reversal in perspective helps teams uncover hidden risks, challenge assumptions, and proactively strengthen their plans. By imagining a future failure, stakeholders are encouraged to voice concerns that might otherwise go unspoken, making the process a powerful tool for improving decision-making, increasing resilience, and fostering a culture of foresight and constructive skepticism.


## Pre-Mortem: Why Neighbor 911 Failed

Scenario: It's two years after launch, and unfortunately, Neighbor 911 has been discontinued.

What Went Wrong:

- Community Adoption Was Too Slow: Despite initial enthusiasm, the platform struggled to get enough neighbors to consistently volunteer. Without a critical mass of active users, the service never reached the reliability needed to be truly helpful.

- Regulatory and Liability Hurdles: The concept faced significant legal pushback. Concerns from local governments, police departments, and insurers about liability in emergency situations made it difficult to scale. Even well-intentioned neighbor responders were wary of legal risks.

- Trust and Safety Incidents: A few high-profile cases where neighbor interventions went wrong (either misunderstandings or delays) eroded public trust. This negative media coverage discouraged new users from joining and led to a decline in participation.

- Tech or Infrastructure Overload: The complexity of integrating with existing emergency systems proved more cumbersome than expected. The app faced technical glitches, and it never quite delivered a seamless experience that people could rely on in a pinch.

## Pre-Mortem: Why Neighbor 911 Succeeded

Scenario: It's two years after launch, and Neighbor 911 has become a trusted name in community-based emergency support.

What Went Right:

Strong Community Engagement: The platform successfully tapped into local volunteer networks and neighborhood watch groups. Early adopters became enthusiastic advocates, and positive word-of-mouth helped it spread naturally. The sense of community empowerment really resonated with people.

Partnerships with Local Authorities: Instead of facing resistance, the team worked closely with local police, fire departments, and EMS services. These partnerships turned Neighbor 911 into a complementary layer of support rather than a competitor or liability. This collaboration built trust and ensured smoother integration.

Clear Safety Protocols and Training: The platform invested heavily in user education. Volunteers had access to well-structured training modules and clear guidelines, minimizing the risk of mishandled situations. As a result, incidents were rare and the public felt safe using the service.

Scalable and Reliable Technology: Technologically, Neighbor 911 delivered a smooth, user-friendly experience. The app’s infrastructure scaled well, handled peak usage, and earned a reputation for reliability, which encouraged more people to join and stay engaged.
