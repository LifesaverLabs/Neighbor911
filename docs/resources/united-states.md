## 🚨 START YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD EMERGENCY NETWORK TODAY

**You don't need to wait for Neighbor 911™ to be built.** The most powerful thing you can do is:

### Knock on Doors. Meet Your Neighbors. Build a Call Tree.

**Start with pencil and paper:**
1. **Walk to your neighbors' homes** and introduce yourself
2. **Ask them to join a local emergency contact network** - explain that neighbors can arrive in 2-3 minutes while ambulances take 8-15
3. **Create a WhatsApp group, NextDoor network, or simple phone list** - whatever works for your street/block
4. **Share what skills people have**: Who knows CPR? Who has an AED? Who's willing to do a wellness check?
5. **Practice helping each other** with small things first

**Recommended territory size:** 0.25-0.5 mile radius (1-2 blocks) - small enough to know everyone

### Mesh Your Network with Neighboring Networks

Once you have a local group:
- **Connect with neighboring blocks** - find other emergency networks nearby
- **Create coverage maps** - define territories so neighbors know which group covers them
- **Fill the gaps** - help neighbors in uncovered areas start their own groups
- **Build redundancy** - overlapping coverage means help is ALWAYS nearby

**The goal:** Complete neighborhood coverage where every home is within a 2-3 minute walk of someone ready to help.

### High-Incidence US Emergencies Neighbors Can Help With

Based on US data, the most common time-critical emergencies where neighbors save lives:

- **Cardiac arrest** (~350,000/year out-of-hospital) - CPR + AED within 3 minutes
- **Sexual assault / consent emergencies** (~430,000 reported/year, ~2-3 million estimated including unreported) - Rapid wellness check / doorknock, active bystander witness presence
- **Opioid overdoses** (~100,000+ deaths/year) - Naloxone delivery
- **Choking** (~5,000 deaths/year) - Heimlich maneuver
- **Falls (elderly)** (~36,000 deaths/year) - Immediate help getting up, preventing injury
- **Mental health crises** - Suicide prevention, companionship during crisis
- **Wellness checks** - Finding people who've fallen, preventing suicide
- **Addiction support** - Quit companion for nicotine/substance cravings
- **Domestic violence** - Active bystander presence, wellness checks

**Your neighborhood network can address ALL of these** - even without special equipment, just by showing up. Sometimes the most powerful intervention is simply knocking on a door or being present as a witness.
