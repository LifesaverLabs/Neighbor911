# Emergency Response Resources by Country

This directory contains curated emergency response resources, training programs, apps, and calmunity groups organized by country. These are resources we promote to our visitors and Minute Responders to strengthen the broader emergency response ecosystem.

## Purpose

Neighbor 911 is part of a larger emergency response "calmunity" (community). We believe in:
- **Promoting existing solutions** that are already working and saving lives
- **Supporting training organizations** that prepare citizens to respond
- **Building partnerships** with complementary apps and services
- **Strengthening communities** through education and readiness

## 🚨 Start Building Your Neighbor Network TODAY

**You don't need to wait for Neighbor 911™ to be built.** The most powerful thing you can do RIGHT NOW is:

### Knock on Doors. Meet Your Neighbors. Build a Call Tree.

**Start with pencil and paper:**
1. **Walk to your neighbors' homes** and introduce yourself
2. **Ask them to join a local emergency contact network** - explain that when emergencies happen, neighbors can arrive in 2-3 minutes while ambulances take 8-15
3. **Create a simple call tree or group chat** using whatever works for your neighborhood:
   - WhatsApp group
   - NextDoor network
   - Facebook group with geolocation
   - Signal group
   - Telegram group
   - Or just a shared phone list on paper
4. **Share what skills people have**: Who knows CPR? Who has an AED? Who's willing to knock on a door for a wellness check?
5. **Practice helping each other**: Start with small things - checking in on elderly neighbors, walking together, being present

**This is calmunity.** Humbly and Hippocratically, home to home and house to house, you can start chain-reacting kindness and emergency care in your neighborhood today.

### Mesh Your Network with Neighboring Networks

**Don't stop at your block.** Once you have a local calmunity group:

1. **Connect with neighboring groups** - Find other emergency response networks within 0.25-0.5 miles (400-800 meters)
2. **Create coverage maps** - Define your territory clearly so neighbors know which group covers their home
3. **Fill the gaps** - Identify areas without coverage and help neighbors there start their own groups
4. **Establish inter-group coordination** - Set up communication channels between neighboring networks
5. **Build redundancy** - Overlapping coverage means help is ALWAYS nearby

**The goal:** Complete neighborhood coverage where every home is within a 2-3 minute walk of someone ready to help.

**Your neighborhood emergency network doesn't need to be perfect.** It just needs to exist. When someone needs help, your neighbors can be there in minutes.

### Vision: Global Calmunity Coverage Map

We're planning to build **Neighbor911.org** - a global mapping solution where:
- **Neighbors can claim territory** - Register your local calmunity group and mark your coverage area on the map
- **See the resource stack** - Type in your address and see ALL resources available to you:
  - Hyperlocal: Your immediate neighbor network (street, block, building)
  - Local: Nearby calmunity groups and volunteer responders
  - Regional: City/county emergency services and community programs
  - National: Apps like PulsePoint™ (US), GoodSAM (UK), Rescue 1122 (Pakistan), or Neighbor 911™ (when built)
- **Find coverage gaps** - See where networks exist and where they're urgently needed
- **Connect with neighboring groups** - Mesh networks together for complete coverage
- **Register your preferred resources** - Each hyperlocal group can list their recommended training providers, equipment sources, and best practices

**Until that's built:** Use whatever mapping tools work locally (Google Maps pins, OpenStreetMap, hand-drawn neighborhood maps) to show where your calmunity network provides coverage.

## 🌍 We Need YOUR Help!

**No one knows emergency resources better than locals.** We're seeking volunteers from around the world to write, maintain, and translate country-specific emergency response resource guides.

**Why your contribution matters:**
- Emergency preparedness saves lives
- Local knowledge is irreplaceable - you know the apps, training providers, and community programs that work in your area
- Native language guides make resources accessible to more people
- You help thousands discover life-saving training and resources they never knew existed

**What we need:**
- **Country guide authors** - Write comprehensive guides for your country (use our [template](TEMPLATE.md))
- **Translators** - Translate guides into local languages (we especially need guides in Spanish, Mandarin, French, Hindi, Arabic, Portuguese, and other widely-spoken languages)
- **Maintainers** - Keep existing guides updated with accurate information
- **Local experts** - Add cultural context and region-specific insights

**Getting started is easy:**
1. Check if your country already has a guide (even if incomplete)
2. Use our [template](TEMPLATE.md) to create or improve a guide
3. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request
4. Or email your contribution to team@lifesaverlabs.org

**Don't worry about perfection!** Even a partial guide with a few local resources is valuable. Other contributors can build on what you start.

## Contributing Resources

We welcome contributions from anyone with knowledge of emergency response resources in their country or region.

### What to Include in Country Guides

**CRITICAL: Focus on your country's unique emergency landscape**

Every country guide should be written FOR and BY locals who understand what emergencies actually happen and what solutions actually work in that region — though a lot of emergencies, like bedroom consent confusion and conflict and cardiac arrest CPR needs, are in some sense universal and sadly still very common everywhere.

- **Best-in-Class Local Emergency Response Apps:** What apps are ALREADY working in your country? Promote them! Every country has its own leaders - these should be prominently featured.
  - Examples: PulsePoint (US), GoodSAM (UK/Australia), Rescue 1122 (Pakistan), SAMU (Brazil), 108/112 systems (India), etc.
- **High-Incidence Local Emergencies:** What emergencies are most common in your country/region?
  - Floods and cyclones (Bangladesh, Philippines)
  - Earthquakes (Japan, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey)
  - Heat emergencies (India, Middle East, Australia)
  - Typhoons (Philippines, Taiwan, Japan)
  - Wildfires (Australia, California, Mediterranean)
  - Winter emergencies (Russia, Canada, Northern Europe)
  - Monsoons, landslides, volcanic activity, etc.
- **Critical Problems Neighbors Can Solve:** What time-sensitive emergencies do YOUR neighbors face that can't wait 8-15 minutes for an ambulance?
- **How to Start a Neighborhood Network TODAY:** Provide country-specific guidance on:
  - Most popular messaging apps locally as an interim solution (WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, Telegram, etc.)
  - Local social networks (NextDoor, neighborhood Facebook groups, local platforms)
  - How to create emergency contact lists
  - How to mesh networks together for complete coverage
  - Recommended territory size (e.g., 0.25 mile / 400m radius per group)
- **Training Organizations:** CPR, AED, first aid, CERT, and emergency response training providers
- **Certification Programs:** Recognized certification bodies for emergency response skills
- **Community Groups:** Local emergency response teams and volunteer organizations
- **Equipment Resources:** Where to find AEDs, naloxone, first aid supplies
- **Government Programs:** Official emergency preparedness and response initiatives
- **Cultural Approaches to Mutual Aid:** How does your culture approach neighbor helping neighbor? (Gotong royong in Indonesia, Ubuntu in Africa, etc.) How does public policy support and protect or interfere with the work of first first responders and good samaritans?

### Quality Standards

All resources listed should:
- Be legitimate, verified organizations
- Have a proven track record
- Be actively maintained/operational
- Align with public safety and emergency response goals
- Not require payment to access basic life-saving information (paid certifications are acceptable)
