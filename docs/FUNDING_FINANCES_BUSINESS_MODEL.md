# Funding, Finances, and Business Model

## Current Financial Status

**We currently do not have a source of financial support.** Neighbor 911 is in the early development stage and is actively seeking funding to support our mission of democratizing emergency response through community-based technology.

## Volunteer Contributions

**All contributions to Neighbor 911 are currently unpaid and at-will, including those of the founder.** We do not currently have funds to compensate volunteers for their time and expertise. 

While this situation isn't ideal for recruiting and sustaining the widest possible network of talent, we hope that many will step forward out of:
- **Civic motivation** - A desire to strengthen community resilience and emergency response
- **Civigious motivation** - A blend of civic duty and civic religious calling to serve others (civigion.us will be built and launched soon to better explain, popularize, and propound the concept of local, national, and international civic religion)
- **Religious motivation** - Faith-based commitment to helping neighbors in need

We recognize the significant sacrifice this represents and deeply appreciate all volunteer contributions.

## Future Compensation Plans

If and when we secure funding, we are committed to discussing how to equitably support those who dedicate significant time and effort to accelerating this project. Our goal is to fairly compensate contributors who make substantial commitments to making Neighbor 911 a reality.

## Seeking Financial Support

We welcome and are actively seeking various forms of financial support:

- **Contributions** - Direct financial contributions from individuals, organizations, or communities
- **Grants** - Foundation grants, government grants, or research grants aligned with our mission
- **Seed Funding** - Investment capital to accelerate development and deployment
- **Advance Demand Contracts** - Pre-orders or commitments from organizations wanting to deploy our platform

## Legal Structure

Neighbor 911 is organized as a **Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)**. This structure allows us to:

- Pursue both profit and public benefit
- Maintain accountability to our social mission
- Attract investment while serving community needs
- Balance stakeholder interests with public good

### Nonprofit Considerations

While we are currently structured as a PBC (not a nonprofit), we can establish a nonprofit arm for donors who require charitable tax deductions. This would involve:

- Creating a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity
- Applying for IRS recognition (process typically takes several months)
- Establishing appropriate governance and operational structures

**Note:** There would be a delay while the nonprofit arm is organized and receives official recognition from the IRS.

## Business Model (In Development)

Our business model for Neighbor 911 is still evolving nascently, but we anticipate we will be able to someday support ourselves and grow sustainably or even rapidly with revenue streams from:

- Software licensing to municipalities and organizations
- Professional services and implementation support
- Training and certification programs
- Insurance industry partnerships and payouts for calmunity service performance and claims cost reduction
- Premium features and enterprise solutions

There are some unbelievably hard ethical questions about whether we can ever paywall or suspend parts of this service for localities that don't help support us. It seems unimaginable that we'd cut off communities who freeload like organizations might for less critical elective goods or services. We will probably find support on the basis of goodwill and achieved good deeds performed by our minuter volunteers for sufferers, or through insurance company and industry support for provably mitigating harm in calmunities, waves of spontaneous or organized giving might support us, or we may need to do periodic fundraising drives like Wikipedia or NPR do depending on how this evolves and how costly this service becomes to maintain without deeper absorption by government or larger social sector organizations with more unlimited funds for security and health objectives like this. 

It is just not clear yet how this will be supportively adequately financed for effective acceleration and deep, stable, broad routinization if and as this project or branches or forks of this project gain meaningful momentum.
