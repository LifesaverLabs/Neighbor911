# Neighbor 911™

## For Everyone: Your Neighbors Are Your Fastest Lifeline

**When seconds count, your neighbors can arrive in 2-3 minutes while ambulances take 8-15.**

Neighbor 911 is a community emergency response network that connects people in crisis with nearby neighbors who can help—whether they're trained responders with life-saving equipment or simply caring individuals willing to be present when someone needs support.

### You Don't Need to Be a Hero to Save a Life

**Everyone can help.** You don't need special training or equipment. Sometimes the most powerful intervention is simply:
- Knocking on a door to check if someone is okay
- Being present as a witness to de-escalate a situation  
- Staying with someone experiencing a mental health crisis
- Walking with a neighbor fighting addiction cravings
- Calling 911 and guiding responders to the exact location

### How It Works

1. **Neighbors Sign Up** - Choose what types of help you're comfortable providing (from basic presence to CPR/AED response)
2. **Someone Needs Help** - When an emergency occurs, the app alerts only nearby neighbors who can assist
3. **Rapid Response** - Neighbors arrive in minutes with turn-by-turn navigation, while professional help is on the way
4. **Lives Are Saved** - Whether through CPR, naloxone, or simply human presence, neighbors make the critical difference

### Emergency Response Resources & Calmunity Partners

**Neighbor 911 is part of a larger emergency response "calmunity."** We believe in promoting existing solutions, training organizations, apps, and community groups that are already saving lives.

**We maintain country-specific resource guides covering:**
- Emergency response apps (like PulsePoint™ in the US)
- CPR, AED, and first aid training organizations
- Community emergency response programs (like CERT)
- Naloxone access and overdose response training
- Mental health first aid resources
- Local emergency preparedness initiatives

**📍 Browse Resources by Country:**
- [🇺🇸 United States](docs/resources/united-states.md) - PulsePoint, Red Cross, AHA, CERT, and more
- [🌍 All Countries](docs/resources/) - Growing list of international resources

**✍️ Help Us Build Global Coverage:**

**We need YOUR help!** No one knows emergency response resources better than locals who live there and speak the language. We're seeking volunteers to:

- **Write resource guides for your country** - Share the apps, training providers, and community programs you know and trust
- **Translate existing guides** - Make emergency preparedness accessible in your native language
- **Keep guides updated** - Help verify and maintain accurate contact information and program details
- **Add local context** - Include cultural considerations and region-specific emergency response practices

**Why contribute?** Emergency preparedness saves lives. By documenting resources in your country, you help thousands of people discover training, apps, and community programs they never knew existed.

**[See our contribution guide](docs/resources/README.md)** or contact team@lifesaverlabs.org to start a new country guide.

### Join the Movement

**We're building a world where no one has to face an emergency alone.** Where communities look out for each other. Where technology amplifies our natural instinct to help our neighbors.

This is about more than an app—it's about strengthening the fabric of our communities and remembering that we are all connected.
