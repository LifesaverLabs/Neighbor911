# Neighbor 911™

## For Everyone: Your Neighbors Are Your Fastest Lifeline

**When seconds count, your neighbors can arrive as first responders in 1-3 minutes while ambulances, police, and fire take 6-15 minutes to arrive.**

### The Problem: Help Arrives Too Late

Every year, thousands die waiting for ambulances that arrive in 8-15 minutes. Cardiac arrest victims lose 10% survival chance every minute without CPR. Overdose victims need naloxone within minutes. Mental health crises escalate without human presence. Bedroom consent conflicts spiral into confusion and harm without active bystanders performing wellness checks. **The help people need is often already nearby—we just need to connect them.**

### The Solution: Neighbor 911

Neighbor 911 is a community emergency response network that alerts nearby neighbors who can arrive in 1-3 minutes with CPR, AEDs, naloxone, or simply caring presence—while professional responders are on the way.

### Why This Works

Your neighbors are already there. They can:
- Start CPR immediately, not in 10 minutes
- Administer naloxone before brain damage occurs
- Provide calming presence during mental health crises
- Perform wellness check door knocks during consent conflicts
- Guide professional responders to exact locations
- **Save lives in the critical minutes before ambulances arrive**

### 🚨 Join the Calmunity NOW

**Action bias saves lives.** Join our community spaces to coordinate, share ideas, and help build this lifesaving network:

- **💬 [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sNdCsNmK)** - Real-time chat, voice coordination, development discussions
- **🗣️ [Reddit r/neighbor911](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighbor911/)** - Community updates, resource sharing, Q&A

**Everyone needs to be in both.** Discord for fast coordination and voice, Reddit for organized discussions and resource discovery. Strong calmunity = strong response capability.

### You Don't Need to Be a Hero to Save a Life

**Everyone can help.** You don't need special training or equipment. Sometimes the most powerful intervention is simply:
- Knocking on a door to check if someone is okay
- Being present as a witness to de-escalate a situation  
- Staying with someone experiencing a mental health crisis
- Walking with a neighbor fighting addiction cravings
- Calling 911 and guiding responders to the exact location

### How It Works

1. **Neighbors Sign Up** - Choose what types of help you're comfortable providing (from basic presence to CPR/AED response)
2. **Someone Needs Help** - When an emergency occurs, the app alerts only nearby neighbors who can assist
3. **Rapid Response** - Neighbors arrive in minutes with turn-by-turn navigation, while professional help is on the way
4. **Lives Are Saved** - Whether through CPR, naloxone, or simply human presence, neighbors make the critical difference

### Emergency Response Resources & Calmunity Partners

**Neighbor 911 is part of a larger emergency response "calmunity."** We believe in promoting existing solutions, training organizations, apps, and community groups that are already saving lives.

**We maintain country-specific resource guides covering:**
- Emergency response apps (like PulsePoint™ in the US)
- CPR, AED, and first aid training organizations
- Community emergency response programs (like CERT)
- Naloxone access and overdose response training
- Mental health first aid resources
- Local emergency preparedness initiatives

**📍 Browse Resources by Country:**
- [🇺🇸 United States](docs/country_resources/united-states.md) - PulsePoint, Red Cross, AHA, CERT, and more
- [🌍 All Countries](docs/country_resources/) - Growing list of international resources

**✍️ Help Us Build Global Coverage:**

**We need YOUR help!** No one knows emergency response resources better than locals who live there and speak the language. We're seeking volunteers to:

- **Write resource guides for your country** - Share the apps, training providers, and community programs you know and trust
- **Translate existing guides** - Make emergency preparedness accessible in your native language
- **Keep guides updated** - Help verify and maintain accurate contact information and program details
- **Add local context** - Include cultural considerations and region-specific emergency response practices

**Why contribute?** Emergency preparedness saves lives. By documenting resources in your country, you help thousands of people discover training, apps, and community programs they never knew existed.

**[See our contribution guide](docs/country_resources/README.md)** or contact team@lifesaverlabs.org to start a new country guide.

### 🏘️ Start Building Your Emergency Network Today

**Don't wait for the app—start building your hyperlocal emergency response network right now.**

**[📖 Know Thy Neighbor Guide](docs/Know%20Thy%20Neighbor.md)** - Learn how to create a "micro-calmunity" (μcalmunity) in your building or neighborhood using simple tools like WhatsApp and cookies.

**What you'll learn:**
- Form a hyperlocal emergency response group (5-10 neighbors within 90 seconds)
- Run "Heartbeat Drills" - fun practice emergencies with cookie rewards
- Build trust before crises happen
- Distribute CPR face shields to your neighbors
- Create muscle memory for real emergencies

**The best time to meet your neighbors is before an emergency.** This guide shows you how to save lives starting today, even before Neighbor 911 launches.

### Join the Movement

**We're building a world where no one has to face an emergency alone.** Where communities look out for each other. Where technology amplifies our natural instinct to help our neighbors.

This is about more than an app—it's about strengthening the fabric of our communities and remembering that we are all connected.
