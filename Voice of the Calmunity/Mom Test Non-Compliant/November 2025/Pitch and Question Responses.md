Boca Raton Food Service Worker, Male 20s
----------------------------------------
Talked with worker at Chipotle, a tall male likely in his 20s. I told him a bit about the project and asked him if he would respond to a Neighbor 911 call. At first he was uncertain and noncommittal, because the picture I had painted for him was a case of domestic violence, and it turned out he was fearful that he might be walking into a situation where there's a knife or a gun involved. But then I painted him a different picture, a more typical case, where there's a Safeword™ or similar bedroom consent conflict emergency where there's one person who's aroused and not listening or heeding boundaries and another who's in flight, fight, freeze, or fawn response. He changed his mind and said he probably would be happy to go and do a doorknock to keep anyone vulnerable safe in a situation like that.

I also talked to him about whether he felt it would be a good idea for us to offer reward incentives / interruption compensation of $18 or $36 for that kind of service. He felt like in the context of bedroom consent conflicts offering interruption compensation or rewards might interfere with civic and safety-focused motivation and might also draw out the wrong kinds of people for the wrong motives. He felt uncomfortable with the idea of being paid back $18 or $36 for interrupting a consent conflict. I asked him about another example, whether it would make sense to offer a reward bounty for a lost dog, to motivate people to keep their eyes out for and report or chase after a dog that was lost in the neighborhood. He reacted by saying that in that context rewards made a lot of sense to him as a way of promoting the sad situation to enough people's attention.

He was pretty excited by the project potential and wanted to confirm his memory of the name of the service, double checking that this project was called Neighbor 911. 

Boca Raton Teens, Two Males, 13 and ~15
----------------------------------
I had two young teen males asking me what code I was working on on my laptop, and I explained to them the fundamentals of Neighbor 911™. I said to the younger one, who was 13, that I thought he could keep someone alive with CPR; I thought he was likely old enough. He said he didn't know (he hasn't been trained yet), and the 15 year old confidently said he learned CPR in school and felt calmfortable doing CPR if necessary in an emergency.

I looked up age requirements for good-quality CPR after this conversation and the American Heart Association finds that 12+ year olds are generally capable of good-quality CPR with regular 2-inch depth chest compression. Younger than that many 10-12 year olds don't have the strength or body weight to achieve 2 inch chest compression. Persons who are age 15+ are generally fully equivalent to adults on sustained CPR chest compression for multiple minutes, with swapping with another rescuer.

<10 → Can help, call 911, use AED, maybe do shallow compressions
10–12 → Can perform CPR but may not consistently reach required depth, and may not be able to do rescue breaths
12–14 → Most can perform effective adult-quality CPR with rescue breaths
15+ → Equivalent to adults 

Boca Raton SCORE Mentor / Advisor
---------------------------------
Talked with a SCORE mentor about this pivot into launching an open source project for Neighbor 911™. He urged me to do a lot more interviews with people to figure out the voice of the calmunity and what people actually need, and whether there really is a need. He pointed out that in his gated calmunity, there's a security guard about a minute away from his house who could respond to an emergency if called. Neighbor 911™ could be valuable for him as a way of connecting him to his security guard in an emergency, but for him the 24/7 security guard he has within a minute's reach may be a suitable option for a lot of emergency response cases like choking or maybe even solitary rapid CPR.

He recommended focusing on a very small, local market at first, to achieve a sustained small two-sided market of sufferers (demand) and minute responders (supply) where demand and supply testing could begin and be sustained, ideally picking on a very dense urban center like New York City, LA, Chicago, or Miami, where there's an incredible amount of density where neighbor response could be incredibly blazing fast versus full reliance on police or EMS. He emphasized that suburban neighbor response times won't be quite as low as urban apartment responses.

He encouraged us to continue having conversations compliant with the Mom Test to make sure that what we're designing or building matches untampered existing calmunity needs on a serious enough problem that exists that neighborhoods will bang down our door to get us to launch in their neighborhoods. 

He also pointed me / us to an interview with the NextDoor CEO on "How I Built This", suggesting that we could learn from the launch of NextDoor, or by implication partner with NextDoor to test and spread Neighbor911 to a few NextDoor calmunities.

# Local Fire Station Visit — Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Station 57

I visited my local fire station to discuss the Neighbor 911 proposal and received substantial, valuable feedback. While I won't use names, I'll reference station roles where relevant. I spoke primarily with the Station Chief, though station staff contributed insights and digital resources throughout, and the District Chief shared his perspective on where the boundary should fall between Neighbor 911 responder networks and professional Fire Rescue response.

---

## PulsePoint and Existing Emergency Response Apps

The Station Chief and staff recommended PulsePoint, an app enabling neighbors to respond to cardiac arrests. Its welcome screen reads: "PulsePoint: SAVE A LIFE: Get alerted to a nearby Sudden Cardiac Arrest so you can start CPR and find an AED in the critical minutes before first responders arrive."

PulsePoint is an excellent app that immediately addresses one of Neighbor 911's core requirements, yet it lacks sufficient popularity. Despite having over one million downloads, I'd never heard of it, and no one I've consulted has mentioned it. Given my commitment to lifesaving response, if I haven't encountered it, the app isn't reaching enough people.

### Questions About the PulsePoint Model

PulsePoint only sends CPR alerts for incidents in public places. Why exclude private homes? Perhaps because they receive alerts exclusively through 911 calls, creating no clear chain of permission or authority for responding neighbors to enter private residences. This suggests Neighbor 911 might need an opt-in system where property owners designate their homes as "enterable" or even "breakable" during verified emergencies—something PulsePoint hasn't addressed.

Corner cases exist, such as when a friend suffers an emergency at my house. If I haven't opted my property in but my friend's settings authorize entry or forced entry, the property owner's preferences should currently govern under the law. An exception might arise if a responder defends breaking and entering on religious freedom emergency rescue grounds—a challenging case that would likely depend on specific circumstances regarding the emergency's nature.

PulsePoint also restricts alerts to 0.25 or 0.50 mile radii, with local official rescue communities (typically fire districts) setting the distance. Different radii likely attenuate response density in urban and suburban areas while extending reach in rural areas with longer average response times. As administrative procedure, this system works reasonably well, allowing local communities to tune response radii to local conditions quickly and cost-effectively.

PulsePoint succeeds in continuously monitoring location in the background and alerting responders wherever they are—excellent engineering. I haven't yet experienced a PulsePoint alert but hope to in coming months.

Should Neighbor 911 reproduce independent versions of PulsePoint features using a more open-source model? We may need to wrestle with that decision. PulsePoint lacks categories I believe are essential, such as bedroom consent conflicts that Safeword requires.

### Incentives for Response

We discussed incentives for neighbors to respond during inconvenient times—at night, on date night, during important events, or during workdays—to sustain high-quality emergency response rates. I asked whether incentives would strengthen the community or undermine intrinsic civic motivations for emergency response.

The consensus was that this question exceeds fire station expertise and requires testing or decision-making (and funding) at a different community level. Staff mentioned Amphibious Medics, an app for off-duty emergency service workers that provides incentives for responding to local events.

## Specific Emergency Scenarios

### Drowning Rescue

We agree that not all drowning rescues are safe for non-lifeguards. However, I argue that many scenarios exist—particularly shallow-water situations involving small children in Florida home pools—where someone with amateur swimming ability (like myself) could readily save a struggling child or infant if alerted in time through camera-based AI or Neighbor 911 network alerts. In shallow water, even larger adults might be rescuable. Open water and canals present different challenges, though strong swimmers and especially former lifeguards might still be capable of saving someone in dangerous situations.

### Fire Rescue

The District Chief and Station Chief emphasized strongly that it's extremely dangerous and unwise to consider whether Neighbor 911 responders are brave enough to enter a burning building, even believing children are inside. Such attempts likely produce additional suffering—untrained responders becoming smoke inhalation victims trapped in the building. Moreover, opening doors could oxygenate fires with paradoxical effects, complicating professional rescue efforts. Reports of children inside could also prove false, meaning neighbors might suffer burns or smoke inhalation and potentially die for nothing.

The same applies to car crash rescue, especially involving fire—extremely high risk situations where professional fire rescue wants control without encouraging bystander intervention.

I suggested deploying Neighbor 911 responders as witnesses to house fires, allowing close neighbors to make their own determinations based on evolving knowledge and delay until fire services arrive. They felt this approach—waking formerly sleeping neighbors to calculate how brave or reckless to be in rescue attempts—was a recipe for disaster. These decisions should remain with specialized fire professionals who understand rapid survival calculations.

Hearing this, I recognized my relative ignorance about these choices and stated I wouldn't involve Neighbor 911 in active fire rescue.

### Other Medical Emergencies

We discussed cardiac arrest rescue and choking alongside drowning.

The chiefs noted that a central office headquarters in West Palm Beach handles larger strategic decisions. Palm Beach County frequently makes fire rescue decisions at the county level.

## Notable Statistics and Best Practices

Seattle reportedly has the country's highest resuscitation rate—a notable, trackable statistic worth investigating deeply. Why are they so positively deviant on bystander and neighbor resuscitation success? This is measured as survival to hospital discharge of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). No reason exists why other US areas with comparable neighbor-to-neighbor proximity shouldn't match, compete with, or exceed Seattle's rates. Urban density may contribute, but many cities are dense.

Separating witnessed versus unwitnessed out of hospital cardiac arrest statistics seems necessary, and future metrics should distinguish between "barrier," "break and enter," and "free entry" Neighbor 911 response categories.

## Topics Not Yet Covered

I didn't ask about handling forced entry in respiratory compromise cases—I need to return soon to discuss this with the Station Chief. It's a very difficult key topic.

I didn't discuss hosting drone-delivered AEDs. The dream scenario: a 911 call triggers Neighbor 911 alerts, AED drone dispatch, and EMS response simultaneously. Two neighbors perform CPR, sharing the load and ensuring high-quality compression and rescue breaths, while a third neighbor awaits the AED. Ideally, the AED is applied before emergency services arrive, though EMS takes over professionally upon arrival.

If only two neighbors arrive quickly, should they focus exclusively on CPR, or should one administer CPR while the other waits for the AED drone? Alternatively, should both focus on CPR and rescue breaths while EMS handles defibrillation upon arrival?

I didn't detail major UI choices, design libraries, or user narratives and flows, including whether to assist with intelligent SMS-to-911 text message generation or consistently direct sufferers toward immediate 911 PSAP calls even for lower-grade emergencies. For now, assume all emergency calls route through 911, with 911 PSAP activating Neighbor 911 as a minute-responder network.

---

## Missed Opportunities

I failed to share neighbor911.us with station personnel or ask if they'd participate in community discussion servers or comment on design specs, requirements, and user stories. Their feedback on my questions helps directly and indirectly, but continuous expert input on our communication channels during community proposal, design, and engineering would be far more valuable—to the extent they have spare time.

Additionally, major design choices require community leadership and debate. Significant "technical/schema lock-in" (as Jaron Lanier discusses in "You Are Not A Gadget") could create one-way door decisions regarding how much we push everyone toward 911 and how we parallelize voice AI, SMS-to-911, topic tap, and text entry for incident reporters while critical seconds tick away.

The conversation covered even more ground, but I regrettably failed to take real-time notes on my computer. I relied on conversational memory, which has limits, especially given my sometimes poor recall.

## Footnote: PulsePoint Terms of Service

PulsePoint's terms and conditions require users to agree not to "reverse engineer," "attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof."

These terms create problems for me. I want to catalyze an open-source alternative to PulsePoint. Simultaneously, I have strong civic and religious duty to sign up immediately for their app so I can save neighbors' lives. This moral double bind means I'm obliged both to sign up for PulsePoint and to refrain from learning how they solved the problem.

My resolution: signing up is obligatory, but I'll respect their design choices and intellectual property while finding different ways to solve similar underlying problems. This "anti-reverse engineer" contract pattern proves problematic for engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs working on civic or religious projects at conventional or post-conventional moral levels.

I copied their terms of service for future reference. I would have agreed to virtually any shrinkwrap agreement to fulfill my lifesaving duty.
